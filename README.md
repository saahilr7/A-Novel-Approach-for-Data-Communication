# A-Novel-Approach-for-Data-Communication-Using-Efficient-Clustering-Mechanism 

*************************** NETWORKS PROJECT**********************************
The future network environment will be extremely heterogeneous. There is an increasing need for an eﬃcient means of communication between these various heterogeneous devices. The main aim of the project is to provide an eﬃcient means of communication between diﬀerent heterogeneous devices that are present in a wireless network through an eﬃcient clustering mechanism. Identify various Clustering techniques in wireless networks consisting of heterogeneous nodes Comparison of diﬀerent clustering algorithms and their results in diﬀerent scenarios with respect to heterogeneous device communication Identify and select the routing algorithm for the routing of information between heterogeneous devices.

Some of the important Clustering Protocols are described below:

Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy(LEACH) Clustering Protocol : LEACH protocol is decentralized clustering algorithm that does not oﬀer a complete energy-optimization solution, as it has no strategy for cluster-head positioning and distribution.

Decentralized Energy-Eﬃcient Cluster Propagation(DEEP) Clustering Protocol : DEEP protocol establishes clusters with uniformly distributed cluster heads. This protocol balances the load among all the cluster heads by keeping the clusters radii fairly equal. This protocol is completely decentralized, and there is no need for any location ﬁnder device or hardware. 

K-means clustering : The k-means clustering algorithm attempts to split a given anonymous data set into a ﬁxed number (k) of clusters.


Methodology:

Identify features of the node that wants to send information. Study and analyze the various clustering algorithms available. Deciding On Clustering Algorithms: Based on the properties of the sending device we need to decide on the best suited clustering algorithm such as Hierarchical, Leach, K-means,etc. Find out the accuracy of the eﬃcient communication of devices that is achieved. Compare it with the previous technique before any optimization of the clustering algorithms is made.

1) Deployment of Nodes 
2) Clustering
3) Cluster-Head Selection
4) Reformation of Clusters and Cluster Heads when a mobile node moves to another cluster
5) Base Station for group of clusters 
6) Cross-Layer formation
7) Communication between diﬀerent layers through Base Stations
